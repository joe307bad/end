### Overview

Void is in very early alpha development. There may be bugs and performance issues. Your user or data may be deleted or corrupted at any moment. Play at your own risk.

Currently, the entirety of void's gameplay is generating random planets from the "Explore" page, joining wars from the "Conquest" page, and tracking the leaders of the early void universe from the "Citadel" page.

### Explore - generating planets and starting wars

On the [Explore](/app/home) page, you can generate planets and enact wars with a few settings: the limit of players able to join, the limit of rounds for the war, and the limit of battles for each player's turn. A "round" is complete when all player's have completed a turn. During a turn, a player can engage in many battles.

### War - main gameplay mechanics

Select "Start war" from the "Explore" page to start a war. Once a war is started, other players must join the war. When two or more players have joined the war, the war can commence and the user who started the war has the first turn.

#### Turn progression

Each player has one turn within every round. A player has three possible actions during a turn:

1. <strong>Set a portal</strong> between any two territories. After you engage in a battle, the portal cannot be moved for the rest of the turn.
2. <strong>Deploy troops</strong> to any territory. Every user can deploy 10 troops per turn.
3. <strong>Attack</strong> any territory. Attacking creates a battle. Every time a territory is attacked, there is a 50/50 chance for both the attacker and the defender to lose 1 troop.

### Capturing a planet

A planet is conquered whenever the round limit of the war is reached or a single player controls all territories.

### Conquest - tracking active and past wars

The [Conquest](/app/conquest) page shows all the wars in the void universe. The two most recently updated user-engaged wars will appear pinned to the top of this page.

#### Citadel

The [Citadel](/app/citadel) page is where you can see the leaders of the void universe.
